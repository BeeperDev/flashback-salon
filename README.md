# Flashback Salon
This site is for one of my small business freelancing clients. The 3 page site allows for new and existing clients to learn more about her salon services and schedule booking requests via email form.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This project showcases my front end developer skills along with UI/UX awareness. Having a beautiful, seemless, functional design on any device will make your company stand out on the web. This site will help with client retention and discovery from potential clients and referrals.

## Optimizations
I will update the site as client requests. (eg. current rates of the industry, social media profiles) I'd like to add more animation and transitional css and javascript for user interactivity.

## Lessons Learned:

I love using Netlify's services for clients that want a simple presence online. The contact forms for email communication is a great feature.
